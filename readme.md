# Pastebin website

## Features

This website allows for users to enter in text to be shared with others via a link.
This saved data can be private, or public; which influences whether the item is queryable to others.
The search function allows for users to search by title, or by the unique link code, if they desire.

## Technology

The tech stack of this setup is very simple. It is a django front & backend, with some css for styling. In my opinion, javascript would be inefficient to shoehorn in.
